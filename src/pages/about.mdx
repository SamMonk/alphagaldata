AlphaGalData is an independent project focused on clear, practical information about alpha‑gal syndrome (AGS).
We combine public data, plain‑language guides, and simple tools to help people navigate symptoms, prevention,
and conversations with clinicians.

This site is educational only and not medical advice.
