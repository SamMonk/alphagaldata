Use these instructions to print durable wallet and dining cards that stay legible when you need them. You can print at home or send the PDFs directly to a local or online print shop.

## Gather supplies

- Heavy 80 lb cover stock or pre-scored business card paper for the wallet card.
- 4x6 inch index cards or photo paper for the dining card.
- A sharp paper trimmer or scissors, plus laminating sleeves if you want extra durability.

## Print at home

1. Download the PDFs below so you can print the original resolution files.
2. Set your printer to landscape orientation and 100% scale (no fit-to-page).
3. Print a test sheet on plain paper to check alignment before moving to heavier stock.
4. Trim along the guides, fold the wallet card, and laminate if desired.

## Send to a print service

1. Share the PDF with your provider. Mention that the wallet card should stay true credit-card size and the dining card should remain 4x6 inches.
2. Ask for matte or satin finishes so you can write on the back.
3. Request a few spares so you can stage cards in travel bags and vehicles.

      Store a digital copy of each card in a shared family folder so someone else can reprint if you lose yours. Include a note about the date you last updated medications.
