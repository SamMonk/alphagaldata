Handing a ready-made dining card to restaurant staff keeps the conversation focused on ingredients that matter. The printable card below gives cooks and servers a clear checklist so meals stay free of mammalian products.

## How to use it with staff

- Present the card while you are greeted or when the server takes drink orders so the kitchen has extra time.
- Politely confirm the kitchen shares the card during handoff. Follow up before the meal arrives if you have not heard back.
- Keep a photo of the card on your phone in case you forget a printed copy.

## Customize before printing

- Fill in personal sensitivities (for example, gelatin capsules or dairy) in the notes field.
- Add a preferred emergency contact and the time window when reactions usually start for you.
- Translate the notes section into the local language when traveling internationally.

## Prep for events and caterers

- Give the card to event planners or caterers during menu planning instead of waiting for service.
- Pack extra cards in your bag or car so friends can advocate for you if you become symptomatic.

      Encourage restaurants to keep the card with your ticket or point-of-sale notes so future visits are easier. Always double-check dishes before eating.
