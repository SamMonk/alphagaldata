Having a concise card in your wallet helps emergency responders and new clinicians understand your alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) history when you cannot talk through it. Use the printable wallet card to highlight the essentials and steer conversations toward safe care.

## When to hand it over

- At urgent care, emergency rooms, and new specialist visits where teams are learning your history in minutes.
- When friends or family might need to explain your allergy quickly on your behalf.
- During travel so unfamiliar providers have a summary in an easy format.

## What to write on it

- Your name, emergency contact, and the clinician who confirmed AGS.
- A sentence about delayed reactions to mammalian products and any co-existing allergies (for example, gelatin or dairy).
- Current rescue medications and when to use them. Keep wording short so staff can scan it fast.

## Keep it ready

- Print on card stock or laminate after folding so it survives daily wear.
- Store one in your wallet and another in a go-bag or glove compartment.
- Update the card when prescriptions, diagnoses, or contact details change.

      Share the card when you hand over insurance details so it becomes part of the intake workflow. Always confirm with clinicians that the note is in your chart.
