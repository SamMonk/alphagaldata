Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a tick-associated allergy to a carbohydrate
called galactose-α-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) found in most mammals. Many
people experience delayed reactions (often 3–6 hours) after eating mammalian
meat or products containing mammalian-derived ingredients.

This site provides educational information only and is not medical advice. If
you suspect AGS, consult a board‑certified allergist.
