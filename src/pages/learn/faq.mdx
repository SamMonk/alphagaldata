## <IconInfo className="text-teal-700"/> What is alpha-gal syndrome?

An allergy related to tick exposure that can cause delayed allergic reactions to mammalian foods.

## <IconInfo className="text-teal-700"/> Why are reactions delayed?

Alpha-gal is absorbed with fats, which are digested more slowly, leading to symptoms 3–6 hours later for many people.

## <IconInfo className="text-teal-700"/> Is this medical advice?

No. This site is educational only. Consult a board‑certified allergist for medical guidance.

## <IconBrandTick className="inline-block align-text-bottom"/> How are ticks related to AGS?

Tick bites are linked to sensitization to alpha‑gal. Reducing tick exposure can lower the chance of developing AGS.
