Living with alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) means re-learning food labels, menus, and everyday products. This guide digs into the high-risk items identified through our automated FDA + Open Food Facts pipeline and packages them into plain-language rules you can put into practice immediately.

## High-risk foods and ingredients

- **Red meat & organ meats** — beef, pork, lamb, venison, and wild game nearly always carry the alpha-gal sugar.
- **Hidden gelatin** — common in capsules, marshmallows, gummy vitamins, and some dairy stabilizers. Check the source or opt for plant alternatives.
- **Dairy fat and cream** — while some patients tolerate low-fat dairy, ingredients like heavy cream and butter can trigger reactions.
- **Enzymes & additives** — look for terms such as *animal rennet*, *enzymes*, *natural flavors (meat-derived)*, or *tallow*.

Our `ingredients.json` dataset keeps these examples current. It flags the risk level, provides quick references, and is refreshed nightly from FDA enforcement data and open product datasets. Developers can reuse the JSON for custom alerts, recipe scanners, or grocery list checkers.

## Everyday swaps

| Instead of… | Try… |
| --- | --- |
| Beef burgers | Chickpea, black bean, or mushroom patties |
| Gelatin-based desserts | Pectin- or agar-based gummies and desserts |
| Pork sausage | Turkey or plant-based sausage |
| Heavy cream | Oat, coconut, or soy creamers |

## Dining out and social events

1. Ask about broths, gravies, and cooking fats — many kitchens use beef or pork stock as a base.
2. Confirm fryer oil — shared fryers with breaded meats can cause cross-contact.
3. Mention ingredient lists for sauces and glazes — Worcestershire sauce, for example, frequently contains anchovies (safe) *and* natural flavors (double-check).

Print or save the latest **Dining** and **Wallet** cards from our `/cards` hub so you’re never caught without a concise explanation of your restriction.

## Medication & personal care checkpoints

- Capsules: choose veggie capsules or talk to your pharmacist about compounding options.
- Vaccines & biologics: consult with your allergist; several include gelatin stabilizers derived from mammalian sources.
- Cosmetics & toiletries: tallow, lanolin, and collagen are common add-ins to soaps and lotions.

## Building a personal avoidance list

1. Log your reactions and suspected triggers in a shared document or notes app.
2. Compare against the **high-risk** and **medium-risk** entries in the ingredient dataset.
3. Customize the PDF wallet cards with your specific red flags using the affiliate print partners in the `/cards` hub.
4. Revisit every quarter — our automated pipeline feeds new findings directly into the dataset and the `/learn` section.

Remember: alpha-gal sensitivities vary. Partner with your allergist to validate these guidelines and adapt them to your tolerance thresholds.
