safety_notes:
  - "Pillsbury Crescent Roll Sheets: verify the ingredient list on your package shows 'vegetable oil' or 'vegetable shortening' — NOT lard. Formulas vary by region and can change. Always check before buying."
  - "Plant butter: choose a certified dairy-free variety (e.g. Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks, Miyoko's Creamery). Confirm no dairy-derived ingredients on the label."
  - "Oat milk: most oat milks are safe, but verify no carrageenan on the label. Good options include Oatly (Barista edition sometimes has it — check), Califia Oat, or Three Trees Oat."
  - "This recipe contains no mammalian meat, gelatin, lard, or dairy — as verified with the ingredient options listed above. Individual product formulations can change; re-verify with each purchase."
  - "If you also react to wheat or gluten, note this recipe is NOT gluten-free."
ingredients:
  - "1 (8 oz) package Pillsbury Crescent Roll Sheets (verify: no lard)"
  - "2–3 tablespoons plant butter, softened (dairy-free, e.g. Earth Balance)"
  - "¼ cup brown sugar"
  - "1 teaspoon cinnamon (adjust to taste)"
  - "1 cup powdered sugar (for frosting)"
  - "2 tablespoons plant butter, melted (for frosting)"
  - "Oat milk as needed for frosting consistency (carrageenan-free brand)"
steps:
  - "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper."
  - "Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl. Set aside."
  - "Unroll the crescent sheet on a clean surface. Spread softened plant butter liberally over the entire surface."
  - "Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over the buttered sheet."
  - "Roll the sheet up tightly from one long edge. Cut into 8 equal portions and place cut-side up on the prepared baking sheet."
  - "Bake 10–12 minutes until golden brown."
  - "While rolls bake, make the frosting: whisk together powdered sugar and melted plant butter. Add oat milk 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring until smooth but not too thin."
  - "Allow rolls to cool at least 5 minutes before frosting. Drizzle or spread frosting over warm rolls and enjoy."
